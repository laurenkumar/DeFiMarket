## Zillica Dapp
Decentralised Apps ("dApps") are applications that interact with smart contracts on the blockchain. As Zilliqa blockchain is a decentralised network that is not hosted by a single entity, application that sits on the blockchain is decentralised.

An application can have a user-facing components ("client"), which could be a web application or mobile app. These applications can interact with smart contracts on the Zilliqa blockchain.

The entry to Zilliqa blockchain lies on the RPC interface. SDKs are not compulsory for you to interact with the blockchain, but they do make your life easier.

Saw the 0x1, 0x2 on the entities on the blockchain? Those are addresses.

Addresses are an identifier to an entity on the blockchain. An entity on the blockchain can be either a user or a contract.

The contract will be deployed using the Scilla IDE.

## Contract Planning
The logic of the contract is planned with the point of view of a marketplace. No commission will be taken from the transactions done by the user.

# Listings
Listings are the products that can be posted on the platform, which are subsequently made available to the buyers.

We allow the creation of user accounts to facilitate using the platform. The accounts can have one of two roles:

A Buyer Account
A Seller Account

## To Do

-Write Scilla Contracts for the selling, transactions and profile part
- Create a messaging app between buyer and seller

---

## Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop and run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.
Then run `yarn dev` to start the application locally

Change the .env.example file to .env.local and fill the empty fields
